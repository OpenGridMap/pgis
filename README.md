## Installation

1. Install PostgreSQL and PostGIS:

  * Ubuntu:

    ```
    sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.3
    sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.3-postgis-2.1
    sudo apt-get install postgresql-server-dev-9.3
    ```
  * OS X

    Easiest way is to download and install the [postregapp](http://postgresapp.com/). Download [PostgreSQL 9.3 with PostGIS 2.1](https://github.com/PostgresApp/PostgresApp/releases/download/9.3.10.0/Postgres-9.3.10.0.zip) and copy the app to your `/Applications` folder.


2. Create database and enable postgis:

  ```
  sudo -u postgres psql
  > CREATE DATABASE gis;
  > \connect gis
  > CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
  ```
  <b>Note:</b> Mac users who have downloaded the postgres.app might have to mind the username passed with `-u` in the command above. The user `postgres`(which is default in many postgres installations) might not be present. The postgres.app will create an user with the same username as a your OS X's username as default user. So use your OS X's username instead of `postgres`

3. Miniconda
  Download and install miniconda package, containing conda package manager and Anaconda distribution of Python. (Use Python version 3.4)
 * Ubuntu

    ````
    wget http://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ````

    follow the instructions of the installation process.

 * OS X

    Download and run the [Anaconda3-2.3.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg](https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-2.3.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg) installer from https://repo.continuum.io/archive/index.html which contains the correct python version(which is 3.4) we use for the project.

4. Create a virtual environment for the project:

   ````
   conda create -n pgisenv anaconda python=3.4.1
   ````

5. Clone the repository:

   ````
   git clone git@github.com:OpenGridMap/pgis.git
   cd pgis/
   ````

6. Setup datanase: Copy `database.yml.example` to `database.yml` and edit to match your machine's configuration:

   ````console
   cp database.yml.example database.yml
   ````
   Now, edit `database.yml` to match your machine's configuration.

7. Activate virtual environment:

   ````
   source activate pgisenv
   ````

8. Install Python dependencies:

   ````
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ````

9. Run migrations:

   ````
   ./manage db upgrade
   ````

10. Install nodejs, npm (Used by less asset compiler) and less:

   ````
   sudo apt-get install nodejs
   ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
   sudo apt-get install npm
   sudo npm install -g less
   ````

11. Install kmeans clustering extension for Postgis:

  * Ubuntu:

    ````
    wget http://api.pgxn.org/dist/kmeans/1.1.0/kmeans-1.1.0.zip
    unzip kmeans-1.1.0.zip
    cd kmeans-1.1.0/
    export USE_PGXS=1  # in bash

    make
    make install
    psql -f /usr/share/postgresql/9.3/extension/kmeans.sql -U postgres -d gis
    ````
  * OS X
    *  Download and unzip [http://api.pgxn.org/dist/kmeans/1.1.0/kmeans-1.1.0.zip](http://api.pgxn.org/dist/kmeans/1.1.0/kmeans-1.1.0.zip) then
       ````
       cd kmeans-1.1.0/
       export USE_PGXS=1  # in bash

       make
       make install  # note the output and find the location where the kmeans.sql extension is being installed
       ````
    * From `make install` note the location where the `kmeans.sql` extension is being installed. If you have installed postgres via the `postgres.app`, the installation location is most likely to be `/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/<your version>/share/postgresql/extension/`.
    * With the location, run the command below

       ````
       psql -f /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/<yourVersion>/share/postgresql/extension/kmeans.sql -U postgres -d gis
       ````

       Note: `postgres` is the username passed to the `-U` option. Use the right username based on your postgres installation.



## Running

With a built-in server (not ok for production):

```
./manage runserver
```

for production:

```
gunicorn app:GisApp --bind localhost:3000
```

## Testing

```
nosetests tests
```

## Troubleshooting Installation - On OS X

* During `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   *  Generic:
     *  If you face any issue during this stage, the best thing to do is to match the error to those that are below. If you do not find instructions about it here, your best move should be to find which library or package is failing and try to install it seperately.
       *  Find the version required from the `requirements.txt` of that library/package that is failing and install it with `conda install <package>=<version>`
   * `Library not loaded: libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib` while installing cryptography
        * in the active bash session, do `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/anaconda/lib` and re-run the command in then same bash session.
        * If you use a different bash session, the environmental variable will be lost. If you want this to be present in any future bash session, add the `export` line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file.
   * `Error: could not invoke ['llvm-config', '--version']`
     * you need to install `llvmpy` on your conda env. According to the requirement.txt file, you need the version 0.12.7. You can install it with `conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/sklam llvmpy=0.12.7`.
     * From the command, you install `llvmpy` from sklam's repo instead of the usual anaconda's repo. You could also install from anaconda directly by `conda install llvmpy=0.12.7`. I installed sklam`s version because the other failed.
   * `Error: pg_config executable not found.`
     * Check the `postgresql` installation on your host computer. Find the `pg_config` executable path and append it to your `PATH` environmental variable.
     * If you have downlaoded and use `postgres.app` on your mac as in the installation instructions section, locate the `pg_config` executable in `/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/<your version>/bin` and update your PATH environmental variable.
   * `ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8`
     * Follow the instructions [http://conda.pydata.org/docs/troubleshooting.html#unknown-locale](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/troubleshooting.html#unknown-locale)
   * `ld: library not found for -lhdf5`
     * you need to set an environment variable for this too. Do `export HDF5_DIR=$HOME/anaconda/lib` in the current bash session and re-run the command in then same bash session.
     * If you use a different bash session, the environmental variable will be lost. If you want this to be present in any future bash session, add the `export` line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file.
   *  `error: no member named 'f_tstate' in 'struct _frame'`
     *  Check which package was being tried to be installed while this error happened, it might be Cython. check the version for that package from `requirement.txt` file and do `conda install cython=0.211`. Change the package name and version based on your need.
   * `Found existing installation: Sphinx 1.3.1` or `Cannot remove entries from nonexistent file /Users/Munna/anaconda/lib/python3.4/site-packages/easy-install.pth`
     * This happens when there is a Sphinx installation already, find the version that is needed from the required from requirements.txt file and install that using `conda install sphinx=<version>`
 * During `./manage db migrate`
   * `ImportError: No module named 'flask_resize'`
     * Do `pip install flask-resize`
   * `Library not loaded`
     * Run the following
       * `sudo ln -s ~/anaconda/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/`  (try /usr/lib, if it says operation not permitted even with sudo, do /usr/local/lib)
       * `sudo ln -s ~/anaconda/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/` (try /usr/lib, if it says operation not permitted even with sudo, do /usr/local/lib)

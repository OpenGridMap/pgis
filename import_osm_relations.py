'''
WARNING: This could be a very memory intense script. The variables can grow
huge depending on the size of imports. You are adviced to import in smaller
sizes. We advice you run this with on the +.pbf+ files that have only 
relations related data. Use the command line tool osmosis 
(http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis) to filter out the file to 
contain only power relations and run this script on that
result file. Below is an example script on how to run osmosis.

  osmosis --read-pbf file=bayern-latest.osm.pbf --tag-filter accept-relations power=* --used-way --used-node --buffer --write-pbf file=bayern-latest-relations.pbf

NOTE: This script only imports points and powerlines that are related to a
relation. To import other generic points and powerlines, use the usual
+import_osm_data.py+ script.

This is what we do here:
    1. Save all the points from the file to a temporary table, +temp_points+.
        We user +coords_callback+ of imposm.parser.

    2. Update the points in +temp_points+ with their tags.
        Here, we use +nodes_callback+ of imposm.parser.

        We do it in two steps because imposm.parser's +nodes_callback+ will return
        only nodes that have tags. If we wanna import all the points in the
        file, we should use +coords_callback+ which gives all nodes including
        those that don't have tags.

    3. Read and save relations to +power_relations+ table.
        Relations have members which can be ways or nodes or both.

        We save the relation between the power_relation records and the members
        in a join table +power_relation_members+.
        So, in this same step, also add a record in the +power_relation_members+
        join table with +member_id+ as the id of the members in their respective
        tables. It might b the case that we don't find the member in our database
        yet. In such case, we add +member_id+ as or NULL and update the
        +member_id+ from the later steps when we have the records imported.

    4. Start importing the ways and update +power_relation_members+ creating
       the relationship between ways and relations.
        The ways are structured in osm such that they have the osmid of all the
        points that form them. These points would have been imported in the
        step 1. While importing a way, we take it's points' osmids and query the
        +temp_points+ table to get their coordinates(latitude and longitude).
        Using these coordinates, we generate the linestring for this way and
        save it as +geom+ in the +powerline+ table which holds the records for
        these ways.

        While importing the ways, if we encounter a way whose osmid is
        found in the +power_relation_members.member_osmid+, we will update
        +power_relation_members.member_id+ to this way record's id to maintain
        a foreignkey relation.

    5. Find and update missing node member's relations in
       +power_relation_members+ table.
        Fetch the points from +temp_points+ that has osmid as member_osm_id
        from the +power_relation_members+ table and move them to actual +point+
        table. Get the id of this point from the +point+ table and
        update +power_relation_members.memeber_id+ for a foreignkey relation.

    6. Clean up the database.
        If you have any records in +temp_points+ they can be deleted.

    After all these steps, ideally, you shouldn't have any record in the
    +power_relation_members+ join table that has the +member_id+ value
    0 or NULL.
